# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. With the rapid increase in online transactions and digital payments, detecting fraudulent activities has become crucial for financial institutions to prevent financial losses and protect customers.

## Key Challenges
1. **Imbalanced Data**: Fraudulent transactions typically make up a very small fraction of the total transactions, often less than 1%. This imbalance makes it challenging for models to accurately detect fraud, as they may be biased towards predicting the majority class (non-fraudulent transactions).
2. **Evolving Fraud Techniques**: Fraudsters continuously develop new techniques to evade detection, requiring models to be adaptable and continuously updated.
3. **High False Positive Rate**: Detecting fraud is a high-stakes problem where false positives (legitimate transactions flagged as fraud) can inconvenience customers and damage trust.

## Approach

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and erroneous data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features that might help in distinguishing between fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions.

### 2. Initial Model Training
- **Baseline Models**: Train machine learning models on the unbalanced dataset to establish baseline performance.
- **Common Models**: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting Machines.

### 3. Evaluation Metrics
- Use appropriate metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC-ROC to evaluate model performance, considering the imbalance in the dataset.

### 4. Addressing Imbalance
- Techniques include oversampling the minority class (fraudulent transactions), undersampling the majority class (non-fraudulent transactions), or using algorithms designed to handle imbalanced data.

### 5. Model Improvement and Deployment
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Continuously monitor model performance and update the model with new data to adapt to evolving fraud patterns.
- **Real-Time Implementation**: Implement the model in a real-time system to flag suspicious transactions for further investigation.

## Data
The dataset used in this project contains credit card transactions, with each transaction classified as either fraudulent (1) or legitimate (0). The dataset includes a variety of features representing different aspects of the transactions.

## Steps

1. **Import Necessary Packages**
   - NumPy, Pandas, Plotly.

2. **Load Data**
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   data = pd.read_csv('path/to/creditcard.csv')
   ```

3. **Data Exploration**
   - Display the first few rows and the structure of the dataset.
   - Check the dimensions and summary statistics of the dataset.
   - Calculate and print the fraction of fraudulent transactions.

4. **Data Visualization**
   - Visualize the correlation matrix as a heatmap using Plotly.

5. **Data Splitting**
   - Split the dataset into feature variables (X) and target variable (Y).
   - Convert to numpy arrays and split into training and testing sets using Scikit-learn's `train_test_split`.

6. **Model Building**
   - Build and train a Random Forest Classifier.

## Usage
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
cd credit-card-fraud-detection
```
Run the Jupyter notebook to see the analysis and model training steps:
```bash
jupyter notebook Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb
```

## Results
The model's performance will be evaluated based on metrics like Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC-ROC. The results will help in understanding the effectiveness of the model in detecting fraudulent transactions.
